		<b><big>Requirements/Notes</big></b><hr>
		<p>This plugin is being developed on 3.8.4 of vBulletin and has been tested on 3.6.x, 3.7.x and <b>4.0.x</b></p>
		<p>PHP's <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">libcurl package</a> needs to be installed on your server. <i>Most servers have this installed.</i></p>
		<p>AdminCP -> Usergroups -> Usergroup Manager -> "Unregistered / Not Logged" -> "Can View Forum"<br/><b>This option must be set to "Yes".</b> (You can still block Guests from viewing forums in the Forum Persmissions in the AdminCP.)</p>
		<p>It is recommended that your User Registration Options allow usernames up to 25 characters in length.</p>
		
		<b><big>Installation</big></b><hr>
		<p>1. Upload all files in the UPLOAD directory, preserving the directory structure.</p>
		<p>2. Create the following directories with the following permissions</p>

		<b>Final Notes</b>
		
		<p>When adding boards, removing board, adding network forums, removing network forums, adding messageboards to and removing messageboards from network forums, all the boards on your network will need to be updated with this new information. Use the "Network Updates" in the "Network Manager" to send these updates to the boards on your network.</p>

<b><big>Cron Configuration</big></b><hr>		

Your board will periodically send out updates (mostly new posts/threads). This is done through a cron, either a vBulletin "Scheduled Task" or a 
standard Unix cron.

<p>In 'Scheduled Task Manager' the installer will create a task that is by default disabled. You can enable to the scheduled
	task and set it to run as often as you like.

<p>Alternatively, you can run a system cron. The cron must be run from the directory of the deliver.php script and passed the 'console'
	parameter. An example is below:

<pre style="background:#BBBBBB">
	cd /directory/of/your/forum/network; php -f deliver.php console
</pre>
